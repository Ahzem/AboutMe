## 🎵 Fun Fact

I can play the guitar and sing along. Here is a snippet of me performing a song:

```python
# Lyrics of the song
lyrics = """
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
"""

# Chords of the song
chords = ["G", "D", "C", "G"]

# Function to play the song
def play_song(lyrics, chords):
  # Split the lyrics into lines
  lines = lyrics.split("\n")
  # Loop through each line
  for line in lines:
    # Print the line with a chord
    print(f"{chords.pop(0)}: {line}")
    # Append the chord to the end of the list
    chords.append(chords[-1])

# Call the function
play_song(lyrics, chords)
